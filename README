Programming Question:
Program a simulation of the banker’s algorithm. Your program should cycle through each of the bank clients
asking for a request and evaluating whether it is safe or unsafe. Output a log of requests and decisions to a file.

Source code file:
Bank: is the implementation of banker’s algorithm.
Main: is the main class.

There are two output screenshots to show different results. 
There are three situations: 
1. if safe, it will print the process running order;
2. the first input process can’t be satisfied, it will print the information.
3. in addition to the second situation, for other unsafe situation, it will show which processes are unmarked during running.
